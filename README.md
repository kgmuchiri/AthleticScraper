# Python Scraper for World Athletics Database

## About
This is a python project that takes the large dataset that is the top athletic performance for the most common track and field events and turns it into a csv file.

When run it will take the current date as the end date and gather all the results for each track and field discipline. 

Inspired by: https://github.com/thomascamminady/world-athletics-database/

Used the options.json file from that repo to help

Note: Datasets here were generated on: 2025-06-24

### Repo Structure
 - Output: Folder for the csv files created as a result of scraping
 - Combined: a folder that takes the outputs and combines them on overall discipline e.g. Shot-put and Shot-put 6kg are of the shotput discpline however their records are maintained seperately one the World Athletics Page (intermediary files)
 - Datasets: contains final datasets split by type, individual events and relay events
 - Logs: For any errors that come up while running the scripts
 - Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for EDA.
 - Scripts: Contains all the scripts necessary to generate the datasets.

### To Run
Install requirements from requirements.txt:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run file "run.py":
    python3 run.py
